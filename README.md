# Location-Based Reminder App

The Location-Based Reminder App is a mobile application that provides reminders to users based on their location and proximity to important places or events. This app is developed using Android Studio, Java, XML, and SQLite database.

## Features

- Users can set reminders by adding the title and optional description of the reminder, as well as select the location by pinpointing it on the app interface.
- Users can view all of their reminders in the "View Reminders" section of the app and delete them by swiping left or right.
- The app utilizes GPS and Network providers to detect the user's location and trigger notifications when they are near a location associated with one of their reminders.
- The notification is triggered when the user enters a range of 30 meters from the location of the reminder.

# Abstract
While there are several reminder apps available, most of them rely on time-based notifications and do not take into account the user's location. There is a need for a mobile application that can provide reminders based on the user's location and proximity to important places or events. Hence this app we developed gives reminders to user based on the reminders set by them on the application and their location.
