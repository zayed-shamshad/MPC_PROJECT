# Location-Based-Reminders

# Abstract
While there are several reminder apps available, most of them rely on time-based notifications and do not take into account the user's location. There is a need for a mobile application that can provide reminders based on the user's location and proximity to important places or events. Hence this app we developed gives reminders to user based on the reminders set by them on the application and their location.
